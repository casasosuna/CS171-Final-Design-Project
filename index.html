          Sexual assault is a general term for any type of <strong>sexual activity that occurs without consent</strong>. This could include behavior like unwanted touching or kissing, sexual contact with someone who is under the influence of drugs or
          alcohol and unable to give an informed "yes" or "no", or rape or attempted rape.
